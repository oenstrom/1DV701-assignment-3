Compilation:
Make sure you are in the directory with the `App.java`, `packet` directory and `server` directory.
Then run the following command to quickly compile everything: 
 
find . -name "*.java" > sources.txt && javac @sources.txt

Just compiling the App.java file should work too: javac App.java


Run:
Run the TFTP server with the following command:  
java App
